CISC 3320 Homework 2

Role: Developer

Problem Statement:

Create a multithreaded program that utilizes the PID Manager from the previous assignment. Each thread allocates a PID, sleeps for a random period of time, then releases the PID.

Sleeping for a random period of time simulates the PID cycle in an operating system. The typical PID cycle is assignment to a new process, which executes and terminates, then the associated PID is released.
